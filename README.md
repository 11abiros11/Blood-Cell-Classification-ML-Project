# Blood-Cell-Classification-ML-Project

We employ a Convolutional NN to classify a set of 350 blood cell images, by using data augmentation to create 2510 data samples. We find a training set accuracy of .7225 and a test set accuracy of .7112, even though the model wazs showing signs of improvement with more epochs.

Special thanks to DeepLearning.AI for help in syntax/code help on the CNN structure.
